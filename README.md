# Java 100-Day Challenge with Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my 100-day learning challenge where I am focusing on mastering Java programming language and honing my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). During this journey, I will be committing to learning and practicing daily, and I'll be sharing my progress by uploading programs to GitHub.

## Goals
- **Mastering Java**: Understanding the fundamentals of Java programming, including syntax, concepts, and best practices.

- **Proficiency in DSA**: Learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms, and gaining proficiency in solving problems efficiently.

- **Daily Progress Updates**: Upload a new Java program or DSA-related code every day on GitHub to showcase my progress and share knowledge with the community.

## Daily Routine
1. **Learning Java (Days 1-30)**:
   - Study Java concepts, syntax, and features.
   - Work on practical exercises and small projects to apply the knowledge gained.
   - Read relevant books, articles, or online tutorials to deepen understanding.

2. **Data Structures & Algorithms (Days 31-100)**:
   - Study different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.
   - Understand algorithmic concepts including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.
   - Solve algorithmic problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.

## Progress Tracking
I will maintain a daily log of my learning progress, documenting the topics covered, challenges faced, and achievements. These logs will be uploaded to my GitHub repository.

## GitHub Repository
